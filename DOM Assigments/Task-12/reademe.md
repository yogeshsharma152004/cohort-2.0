# 🎬 DOM Task 12 – Instagram Reels Section

## 📌 Overview
In this project, I created a fully dynamic **Instagram Reels Section** using JavaScript DOM manipulation and Array of Objects. Each reel is generated automatically based on the data provided.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Dynamic reel rendering from Array of Objects  
- Each reel contains:
  - Username
  - Profile Picture
  - Reel Video
  - Like Count
  - Caption
  - isLiked & isFollowed states
- Auto-generated UI using a single card structure
- Fully scalable — just update the data array to add more reels

---

## 🧩 Tech Used
- **HTML** → Basic structure  
- **CSS** → Styling for reels layout  
- **JavaScript** → Dynamic DOM rendering using:
  - `Array of Objects`
  - `forEach()`
  - `innerHTML`
  - event listeners

---

## 🧠 Concepts Learned
- How real apps manage data using objects  
- Mapping backend-style JSON to frontend UI  
- Creating components dynamically  
- Managing UI states like *liked* and *followed*  
- How DOM updates content efficiently based on data  

---

## 🎯 Output
A clean, interactive Instagram-style reels section that loads reels dynamically and behaves like a real social media interface.

---

## 💡 Takeaway
This task gave me strong confidence in handling real-world UI generation using JavaScript. Now I understand better how dynamic feed systems work in apps like Instagram and YouTube.
