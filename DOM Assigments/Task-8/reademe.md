# 🌍 DOM Task 8 – Dynamic Country-Wise Hotel Cards

In this project, I created a fully dynamic UI where all hotel/package cards are generated using **Array of Objects**.  
No manual card creation — **data decides the UI**.

---

## ✨ Features
- Dynamic hotel information based on country
- One card structure → Unlimited cards from data
- Easy to update UI by only changing data in the array
- Fully controlled through JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)
