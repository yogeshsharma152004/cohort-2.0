# DOM Task 6 – Download UI Progress

## 📌 Objective
Create an interactive download UI animation using JavaScript timing functions — updating progress from 0% to 100% inside the DOM.

## 🔥 What Happens in the UI
- When the button is clicked, the download starts immediately.
- Progress text and progress bar width increase step-by-step.
- Button becomes inactive during the downloading state.
- At 100% completion, a success message appears showing how long the download took.
- Button text and styling change to indicate completion.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- DOM selection & manipulation
- `setInterval()` for repeated progress updates
- `setTimeout()` to stop the animation at the right time
- `clearInterval()` to prevent infinite execution
- Dynamic inline styling using JavaScript
- Randomized timing to make each download unique

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
Through this task, timing functions became clearer — especially how they control dynamic behavior and animations in real UI components.
