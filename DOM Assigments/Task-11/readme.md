# 📌 DOM Task 11 – Instagram Follow/Unfollow Feature

## 📚 Overview
In this task, I created a working **Follow/Unfollow system** similar to Instagram using JavaScript DOM manipulation. The goal was to understand how to handle multiple elements with the same class and update their states dynamically.

---

## 🚀 What I Built
- Selected all follow buttons using `querySelectorAll()`
- Looped through the NodeList to add event listeners
- Toggled button:
  - Text: "Follow" ↔ "Unfollow"
  - Color changes to indicate active state
- Applied logic so each button works independently

---

## 🧠 Concepts Learned
- How `querySelectorAll()` returns a NodeList  
- How to loop through multiple elements  
- Updating text and CSS using DOM  
- Understanding UI state toggling  
- Building small features that behave like real apps  

---

## 🎯 Output
A clean and functional Instagram-style Follow/Unfollow system where all buttons respond dynamically based on user interaction.

## 💡 Learning Outcome
This task improved my confidence in handling multiple DOM elements and creating interactive, real-world UI features using JavaScript.
